The {ansible} {productname} node installer automates the setup of a high-availability {rke2a} cluster with {ranchera} on SUSE-based systems. It creates a reliable foundation for deploying {productname} applications. The installation is streamlined through containerized {ansible} playbooks. Additionally, the installer can be configured to add GPU support which installs the {nvoperator}.

Note: The initial implementation is designed to work with the default configuration options for both {rke2a} and {ranchera}.
