[#ai-rancher-extension-roles]
== Workflows and responsibilities

The workflow is defined by a user role and is different for a user and an administrator.

Administrator::
  * Installs {sairancherextension}.
  * Manages users and user roles.
  * creates ClusterRepo repositories.
User::
  * Deploys AI applications using the {sairancherextension}.

[#ai-rancher-extension-benefits]
== Benefits compared to manual deployment

Centralized, role-based control::
  Permissions are enforced inside {ranchera} and split into roles.
  This approach offers greater security and governance without giving everyone {helm} access.
{ranchera} UI–driven workflows::
  Installed and used entirely from the {ranchera} Dashboard.
  Application deployment becomes guided and opinionated.
Opinionated setup for AI workloads::
  Encodes best practices for AI applications, it assumes:
  * private registries
  * controlled deployment paths
  * abstracts complexity away from end users
Secure handling of private registries::
  Uses ClusterRepo objects where repositories are:
  * centrally configured
  * authenticated once
  * reused across clusters
