{sailifecyclemanager} is a {ranchera} UI Extension for managing {productname} components across {kube} clusters.
This extension provides a unified interface for installing, managing and monitoring AI workloads in {ranchera}-managed clusters.
Its usage and administration depends on which user role is being used.

[#ai-lifecycle-manager-roles]
== Workflows and responsibilities

The workflow is defined by a user role and is different for a user and an administrator.

Administrator::
  * Installs {sailifecyclemanager}.
  * Discovers, deploys and manages AI applications from {suse} trusted registries such as {sappco} and {sregistry}.
  * Manages users and user roles.
  * creates ClusterRepo repositories.
User::
  * Installs AI applications using the {sailifecyclemanager}.
  * Manages application instances

[#ai-lifecycle-manager-benefits]
== Benefits compared to manual deployment

Centralized, role-based control::
  Permissions are enforced inside {ranchera} and split into roles.
  This approach offers greater security and governance without giving everyone {helm} access.
{ranchera} UI–driven workflows::
  Installed and used entirely from the {ranchera} Dashboard.
  Application deployment becomes guided and predictable.
Curated setup for AI workloads::
  Encodes best practices for AI applications, it assumes:
  * private registries
  * controlled deployment paths
  * abstracts complexity away from end users
Secure handling of private registries::
  Uses ClusterRepo objects where repositories are:
  * centrally configured
  * authenticated once
  * reused across clusters
