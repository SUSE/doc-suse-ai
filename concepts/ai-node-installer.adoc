:override-title!: 

The {sainodeinstaller} is an automation toolkit based on {ansible}.
It provides a fully automated, repeatable method to prepare and configure {suse}-driven servers for AI workloads.
This approach simplifies and streamlines the installation of selected cluster components.

[IMPORTANT]
.{sainodeinstaller} does *not* install OS
====
{sainodeinstaller} is not an OS provisioning tool.
You need to install a supported OS first on the affected nodes before using {sainodeinstaller}.
Refer to xref:sles-installation-quickstart[] or link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/[{slm} documentation] for steps to install one of the recommended OS.

[#ai-node-installer-architecture]
== How does {sainodeinstaller} work?

{sainodeinstaller} uses {ansible} playbooks to install and configure selected cluster components on a specified group of servers.
All playbooks run inside a containerized execution environment, ensuring portability, consistency and ease of use across developer and production environments. Since the setup is done via the {ansible} playbooks, the process is idempotent — rerunning it will not produce conflicts.
It simply ensures that the system matches the intended configuration.

The installer deploys:

* *{rke2a}* - {suse}'s CNCF-certified {kube} distribution
* _(Optional)_ *{ranchera}* / *{rancherprime}* - centralized multi-cluster management
* _(Optional)_ {nvidia} GPU support - {nvidia} drivers and {nvoperator}

[#ai-node-installer-capabilities]
== Key capabilities

Repeatable cluster bootstrap:: Supports single-node and HA {rke2a} deployments.
Portable execution:: Playbooks run from a container image ensuring consistent {ansible} versions and dependencies.
GPU-ready automation:: Seamless installation of {nvidia} drivers and GPU Operator when supported hardware is present.
Production-aligned choices:: Supports {ranchera} or {rancherprime} deployments, plus idempotent {ansible} design enabling safe re-runs.
Flexible environment support:: Works on bare metal, virtual machines or cloud instances.
